Generate the SSH Key Pair
1. As root, run the following command to generate a new SSH key pair:
ssh-keygen

2.When prompted for a file to save the key, specify /root/.ssh/remoteuser_rsa:
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): /root/.ssh/remote_rsa

3.Press Enter to leave the passphrase blank:
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): [Press Enter]
Enter same passphrase again: [Press Enter]

4.You should see output indicating the keypair was generated:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/realuser_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/realuser_rsa.pub.

5.Copy the public key to the realuser account on remoteuser using ssh-copy-id:
ssh-copy-id -i /root/.ssh/remoteuser_rsa.pub remoteuser@192.168.10.2

6.You’ll be prompted to enter the realuser password for node01. After entering the password,
you should see a confirmation message indicating that the key was added.

7. Test the SSH connection:
ssh remoteuser@192.168.10.2

8. If the connection is successful, you’ll see the hostname of remoteuser and the output 
of the id command showing the remoteuser’s UID, GID, and group memberships:
node01
uid=1001(remoteuser) gid=1001(remoteuser) groups=1001(remoteuser)
